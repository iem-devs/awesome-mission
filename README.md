Think -> Learn -> Implement
========


## Mission
* To have a culture of open source participation, through hands on projects.
* More projects -> more collaboration -> win for all! 

## Why?

* Create an active development & research culture within our students
* Inspiration? Most IIT's and top colleges have their own dev band / groups. See [this](https://sdslabs.co/)
* Active open source collaboration. Trust me, you will learn a TON if you just keep on contributing , hacking, and building OSS products on [Github](https://github.com)
* Lack of information. The thing that differentiates top colleges and us is solely that we lack _right_ information at the _right_ time. Lets start a community to bridge that down!
* Build a better portfolio, get hired / start own startups!

## How?

* Join our Slack Group : [https://iem-devs.slack.com](https://iem-devs.slack.com)
* To get an auto-invite, submit your email on [https://iem-devs-slack.herokuapp.com/](https://iem-devs-slack.herokuapp.com/)
* Be active in the Slack group, lots of ideas, projects, tips, trivia will be shared there.
* The group is divided into lot of [#channels](Channels.md), join whichever you want. [Channels](Channels.md) serve as a purpose of relevant discussions
* Create a [Github](https://github.com/) account, its a MUST!
* We have this github organisation through which we will create projects



## Points

* We will not explicitly teach you about any language or framework, that part you have to figure out on yourself. Believe me, thats quite easy. 
* We will roll out new project plans here, which we will try to implement as much as we can.
* Technology should not be a bar. Take up a flavour, hack on it, and if you find it cool, stick with it
* Mostly we will focus on the chief areas : Android, JS/Web/NodeJS, Python, Data Science & Machine Learning, but that is not exhaustive.
* _Anyone_ can join, as long as they were / are students of IEM. No class distinction, interact freely with anyone.

## Tips

* Follow [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) religiously. The best source of tech information, and top devs lurk there.
* Follow [Github Trends](https://github.com/trending), you will find awesome repositories to follow, fork & contribute
* Be thoroughly conversant with [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* Reduce FB usage, use Reddit instead. Tons of useful subreddits in Reddit



## Bonus

* Interaction channel with the Alumni Network. We will try to onboard as much as Alumnis possible, both in Industry and Academia
* AMA - Ask Me Anything with Alumni's, Developers and Researchers! Check this space for more info.

## Meetups

* Weekly meetups of the group and discussions related to tech and stuff
* Online Meetups started on [14th March, 2016](https://github.com/iem-devs/awesome-mission/blob/master/meetups/meetup-01.md). 


## Questions?

* Open an [issue](https://github.com/iem-devs/awesome-mission/issues)!

## Disclaimer

* This is _not_ affiliated with the college, its purely a student only participation, backed by Alumni Network
* All open source projects should be licensed properly (preferably MIT)
